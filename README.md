# Face-recogntion-using-siamese-nn

Siamese neural network(based on CNN) widely used for one-shot learning or few-shot learning. This is an example of siamese NN for one-shot face recognition. The model architecture is pretty simple. The input is passed through two parallel CNN, and the absolute difference is taken off last layers.
